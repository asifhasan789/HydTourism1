            <h3>ABOUT GOLCONDA FORT:</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              Golconda is a historic fortress and ruined city located in the
              western outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. It was
              originally called Mankal (mānugallu). The fort was originally
              built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of
              mud walls. It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings by Deo Rai, Rajah of
              Warangal during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (1358-1375 A.D.)
              of the Bahmani Sultanate. Following the death of Sultan Mahmood
              Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been
              appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings,
              fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate.
              Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine,
              Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as
              Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in
              ruins.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a
              World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the
              name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there
              being a number of different sultanates). The origins of the
              Golconda fort can be traced back to the 11th century. It was
              originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya
              Empire. The name Golconda is thought to originate from Telugu for
              "Cowherd's hill". It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler
              Ganapatideva 1199-1262 built a stone hilltop outpost — later known
              as Golconda fort — to defend their western region. The fort was
              later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli of
              the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the
              Golconda Sultanate.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Bahmani kings took possession of the fort after it was made
              over to them by means of a sanad by the Rajah of Warangal. Under
              the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan
              Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487-1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a
              governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his
              governance around 1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during
              this period, and Sultan Quli (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally
              became independent in 1518, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty
              based in Golconda. Over a period of 62 years, the mud fort was
              expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi sultans into the present
              structure: a massive fortification of granite extending around 5
              km (3.1 mi) in circumference. It remained the capital of the Qutb
              Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to
              Hyderabad. The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi)
              outer wall enclosed the city.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Golconda fort used to have a vault where the famous Koh-i-Noor
              and Hope diamonds were once stored along with other diamonds.
              Golconda is renowned for the diamonds found on the south-east at
              Kollur Mine near Kollur, Guntur district, Paritala and Atkur in
              Krishna district and cut in the city during the Kakatiya reign. At
              that time, India had the only known diamond mines in the world.
              Golconda was the market city of the diamond trade, and gems sold
              there came from a number of mines. The fortress-city within the
              walls was famous for diamond trade. Its name has taken a generic
              meaning and has come to be associated with great wealth.
